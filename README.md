Comp20 Spring 2013
==================

1. This repo is full of my work for Ming Chow's Web Programming class at Tufts University, spring 2013
2. My favorite project was project 5, a server-side highscores database and API. All the projects gave me an opportunity to teach myself many new skills, but writing this web app gave me the first glimpse of how creating useful tools on the web is actually done, and how any non-brochureware site works.
3. I'm proud of how I structured my code for frogger; it taught me a lot about how to use the power of JavaScript.
4. This course has had a huge effect on my interests in computer science. At the beginning, I thought web programming was spurious and simple; now I see how powerful and useful it is for creating specific tools people can actually _use_. I also discovered how much I love the structure of JavaScript.
