A homage to Frogger in HTML5's canvas.

- All required aspects have been implemented correctly:
	1. The game loads completey without requiring a refresh.
	2. Frogger moves as you direct him to.
	3. The vehicles and logs move.
	4. Frogger loses a life when he hits a vehicle, the water, or the peninsulas of the "home" lilypad
	5. Basic scoring is implemented.
- I worked on my own for this assignment.
- I spent approximately 18 hours on this project.
